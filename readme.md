# üí´Rayel's PortfolioüìÅ

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase various projects, skills, and interests. The website is designed to display information about my background, current projects, and photography hobby. It uses a responsive layout, utilizing **Bootstrap 5** components to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices.

The website includes the following sections:
- **About Me üìñ**: Information about the developer, including language skills and interests.
- **‚öôÔ∏èRecent Projects‚öôÔ∏è**: Showcases the latest web development projects with embedded live demos.
- **üíªTechnologies**: A table displaying various programming languages, frameworks, tools, and databases used in the developer's work.
- **üé†Carousel**: A photo gallery that highlights the developer's photography work.

## How Bootstrap Components Were Used
1. **Navbar**: The navbar is fully responsive, collapsing into a hamburger menu on smaller screens using the `navbar-toggler` and `collapse` components from Bootstrap 5. It links to different sections of the site such as Home, Contact, and Projects.
2. **Carousel**: The carousel component is used to display a gallery of photos with captions. This allows the user to view images with interactive next and previous controls.
3. **Grid Layout**: Bootstrap's grid system is utilized to display content in columns. The portfolio section and the project descriptions use `col-sm-6` to evenly divide the space.
4. **Table**: A responsive table is used to display the developer's skills in programming languages, frameworks, tools, and databases. The table is styled using Bootstrap's built-in classes (`table`, `table-danger`, `table-striped-columns`, and `table-hover`).

## JavaScript Functions

### 1. `alertUser()`
- **Description**: This function triggers a JavaScript alert when the user clicks on an external link (e.g., Github). It warns them that they are leaving the website.
- **Future Integration**: This can be expanded to display a confirmation dialog with options to stay on the page or continue to the external site.

### 2. `addFeedback(message)`
- **Description**: This function is designed to capture user feedback by pushing a message to an array and returning the updated list.
- **Future Integration**: The feedback can be saved to a database or displayed in a user interface (UI) where the admin can view submitted messages.

### 3. `validateEmail(email)`
- **Description**: This function validates whether an email input contains both "@" and "." symbols.
- **Future Integration**: It can be expanded with regular expressions to check for more detailed email formats, improving its validation process.
